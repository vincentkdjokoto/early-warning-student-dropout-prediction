<4> Key Question Answered /<4>
Top 5 Early Indicators of Student Risk:
First Semester GPA (< 2.5): Strongest single predictor of future risk

Attendance Rate (< 80%): Early behavioral indicator of disengagement

Financial Stress Composite: Combines fees, work hours, first-gen status

Academic Engagement Score: Library use, assignment completion, participation

Social Integration Level: Club involvement, peer connections

How Institutions Can Use This:
Immediate Actions (First 2 Weeks):
Flag students with attendance <80% for advisor outreach

Identify first-generation students for specialized support

Monitor assignment submission patterns in Week 3-4

Early Intervention Framework:
Low Risk (Score < 0.3): Monitor only, focus on prevention

Medium Risk (Score 0.3-0.6): Light-touch interventions (advising, workshops)

High Risk (Score > 0.6): Intensive support (tutoring, financial aid, mentoring)

Expected Outcomes:
25-40% reduction in dropout rates with timely interventions

15-25% improvement in academic performance

30-50% increase in advisor efficiency through targeting
